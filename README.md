BFS
===
BFS (bitfrog share) is issued to give bitfroggers the right to hunt transaction fee on bitfrog. It is neither a currency nor alt-coins and it will not be used as currencies on bitfrog. It is a ticket for bitfroggers to capture transaction fee hunting opportunity of transactions process on our platform.
As bitfrog is developed according to Proof of Stake model, chances for hunting transaction fee is calculated based on the amount of shares owned by bitfrogger, which means more shares on hand, more transaction fee you can hunt.
We are currently running a 4 stages donation campaign for you to obtain BFS through donating bitcoin. The amount of the BFS will be prorated over donators based on the total donation and the issued shares within the same stage.
